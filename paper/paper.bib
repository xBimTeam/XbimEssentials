ISO 10303-11:2004 also specifies a graphical representation for a subset of the constructs in the EXPRESS language. This graphical representation is called EXPRESS-G. EXPRESS is a data specification language as defined in ISO 10303-1. It consists of language elements that allow an unambiguous data definition and specification of constraints on the data defined.

The following are within the scope of ISO 10303-11:2004:

data types;
constraints on instances of the data types.
The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:

definition of database formats;
definition of file formats;
definition of transfer formats;
process control;
information processing;
exception handling.
EXPRESS is not a programming language.},

planning methodology is to get the different actors involved in the project to

constructing and planning the production with an virtual build before enforcing it in
real production. VPP utilizes 3D visualization (interactive visualization / virtual
reality) and BIM model during this process.},

  doi = {10.3390/rs70911753},
  abstract = {The need for better 3D documentation of the built environment has come to the fore in recent years, led primarily by city modelling at the large scale and Building Information Modelling (BIM) at the smaller scale. Automation is seen as desirable as it removes the time-consuming and therefore costly amount of human intervention in the process of model generation. BIM is the focus of this paper as not only is there a commercial need, as will be shown by the number of commercial solutions, but also wide research interest due to the aspiration of automated 3D models from both Geomatics and Computer Science communities. The aim is to go beyond the current labour-intensive tracing of the point cloud to an automated process that produces geometry that is both open and more verifiable. This work investigates what can be achieved today with automation through both literature review and by proposing a novel point cloud processing process. We present an automated workflow for the generation of BIM data from 3D point clouds. We also present quality indicators for reconstructed geometry elements and a framework in which to assess the quality of the reconstructed geometry against a reference.},

We will demonstrate a system that utilises BIMs to generate an edge and node graph. This graph will utilise knowledge from the physical security domain to highlight weaknesses in a facilities design. We intend for this system to aid designers from an early stage, allowing for a more accessible application of security knowledge.},
