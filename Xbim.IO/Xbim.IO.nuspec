xBIM is an Open Source Toolkit for developing IFC based applications (BuildingSmart Data model). 
It provides full support for reading and writing geometry, topology and data in accordance with the Ifc2x3 schema.
xBIM reads and writes Ifc, IfcXMl and IfcZip formats.
The xBIM project provides packages to convert IFC models to COBie spreadsheets in both UK and US cultures as well as a range of 3D viewing controls for use with Windows forms, WPF, WEBGL and OpenGL platforms.
