	<description>xBIM Geometry Engine is the core part of the toolkit that deals with geometry creation. It provides support for geometric operations for all Ifc2x3 objects, including boolean cut, union, intersect and slice. 3D visualisation is provided the platform specific xBIM 3D presentation packages, its also open source. xBIM is an Open Source Toolkit for developing IFC based applications (BuildingSmart Data model). It provides full support for reading and writing geometry, topology and data in accordance with the Ifc2x3 schema. xBIM reads and writes Ifc, IfcXMl and IfcZip formats. The xBIM project provides packages to convert IFC models to COBie spreadsheets in both UK and US cultures as well as a range of 3D viewing controls for use with Windows forms, WPF, WEBGL and OpenGL platforms. IOS and Android versions are under development.</description>
